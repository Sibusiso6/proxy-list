## Supported Proxy Types

### HTTP Proxies

HTTP proxies allow you to make requests to websites through a proxy server. This is useful for web scraping or accessing content that may be blocked in your region.

### Socks4 Proxies

Socks4 proxies support TCP connections and are often used for more secure and anonymous browsing. They are suitable for applications that require a higher level of security.

### Socks5 Proxies

Socks5 proxies offer both TCP and UDP support. They are ideal for applications that need a reliable and fast connection, such as gaming or video streaming.
